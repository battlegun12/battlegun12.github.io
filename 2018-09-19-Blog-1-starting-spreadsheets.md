    <td>The strategies that were effective were : I did what they teacher sad and that lead to me only making one mistake where I left a colon which u quickly corrected. I also made sure that I had had everything in the right place for instance the alphabet and the shifted alphabet in coulombs A and B and having the world hello on the row C and on row E having the shifted version of that. I also talked to the person sitting next to me for help quite a few times because it was a little bit complicated in some areas.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that i was reading off the board because this made it so although I was learning I wasn't actually having a go on my own and I was just copying of the whiteboard which was ok for a while but when I had to do it again but on my own without Any help I think it would be a lot harder than what it was today. The habits I need to work on is to stop going around the classroom for help and just ask the people who sit next to me because they seemed to understand it quite well as well and that would of. Ade it easier.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will be more productive and I will try to not copy from the whiteboard by to listen to him and see if I can figure any of what he is saying out his would allow me to be easier to actually it in the future and maybe even be able to do it on my own. To help my own learning I think I should ask my friends a bit more in stared of just looking nice at the board as that doesn't actually help me apart from giving me the correct code to put in.</td>
