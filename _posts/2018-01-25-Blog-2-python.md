    <td>The strategies that were effective were : if I used the sheet that she gave us to be able to learn what code we needed to get the print option we wanted to work out correctly. If we got it to work correctly then we could get some cool things going like your name is Thomas aiden James Treloar. The strategies that I found effective where if it said syntax error I would ask or look at my partners code and see if I've done something I wasn’t meant to or if I need to add something or even just ask him if there’s anything that he put down which I hadn’t this would of worked, because then he could do the same for me and it helped you understand why and what the code does to your program as sometimes it might say syntax error on line 1 and you have to go to line 1 and look at it closely 1 step at a time being sure to make no mistakes then when you find it you can check against the code our teacher put on classroom and then we can be sure about what’s wrong. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that i was reading off the page sometimes so although I might of learnt a little bit I wasn’t actually learning to my full potential as if I was learning to my full potential I could of probably although done a bit less I could of learnt a whole lot more which means that I wouldn’t of have had to do as much homework as that was to spend 10 minutes a day on code academy python. In the future I think I would want to redo that lesson to as best as I can as I think I can do a lot better than what I had actually done as I am normally quite hard working but that lesson I took quite lightly. The final thing that limited my learning was the fact that I may of been talking to my partner a little bit too much and not doing it by myself all the time. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will be more productive and we as a group will learn more from our mistakes. I will improve my learning by doing more work in the lesson talking less to other groups getting distracted less and helping myself and my partner. This will allow me to be more productive in the meantime also helping my partner. This week we learnt how to use real python not just codecademy python as for homework we had to do 10 minutes a day and in the lesson we did some cool things with the print tool as it allowed us to type our full name word by word with initials and everything like that. This also allowed me to see what it was doing. In the future lessons of the term I will improve my working by listening more and chatting less in the times when I do and don’t need to. </td>
