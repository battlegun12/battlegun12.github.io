    <td>I learnt by using the strategies used in class to be able to learn overall how to overcome the problems I faced by using signs. The strategies that we're effective we’re asking my classmates if they were stuck or if I could do the opposite say if I wanted to be able to get some code. This has worked for previous weeks but with the code getting ever harde i had to come up with a new way to be able to do this. I came up with a good idea and  that was that i could use what i had learnt in previou weeks to revisit some sections so i could refresh my memory before doing 11 or so sections on my own.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that i was reading off my partner sometimes so although I might of learnt a little bit I wasn’t actually learning to my full potential as if I was learning to my full potential I could of probably although done a bit less I could of learnt a whole lot more which means that if there comes a test I might of not been able to answer . In the future I think I would want to redo that lesson to as best as I can as I think I can do a lot better than what I had actually done as I am normally quite hard working but that lesson I took quite lightly. The final thing that limited my learning was the fact that I may of been talking to my partner a little bit too much and not learning all that well from what I could of been doing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will be more productive and we as a group will learn more from our mistakes. I will improve my learning by doing more work in the lesson talking less to other groups getting distracted less and helping myself and my partner. This will allow me to not get distracted so much but to be able to learn a lot better. Next time I will change it so I have more time using my knowledge to work out the code and less time using my partners knowledge on how to complete the code as this will allow me to progress more as a student and my dad could help me at home so I do this as he works with. Computers so he could help me on what I’m stuck on. This will allow me to be more productive and i could reach 50 percent of the codecademy python as last lesson left me on the start of python. This lead to lots of problems and i could overcome them within the following weeks.</td>
