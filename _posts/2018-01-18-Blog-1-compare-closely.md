  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using my knowledge of other coding website I had done previously however some of the stages could be hard like having to write 5 lines or as easy as just pressing run. I think that I could of done more work however as although I did get through a chunk I think I could of got through a bit more. Some good strategies were using the hint every so often as it could tell you the code or give you a hint like' remember before printing something out " before and after it' there were many others but that was just an example. I think occasionally talking quietly to the people who sit next to you is a good idea as not only does it help you in your own code but your partner could also learn something. To give an example last lesson eddy told me I had to put the ‘ before my word and I told him it wasn’t working because he needed to have a capital letter. This works as it’s engaging to brain to remember what you did when they ask you for some help as you have to think back to what you did last time to help him. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>things that limited my learning was if I used the hint to much or if I talked to my partner too much. This was because if I used the hint to much I might take it for granted and not end up actually learning anything as i would be relying on the hint. Also if I talked to my partner to much it would limit my learning, because that could end up in me not thinking about it and just asking him to do it for me this wouldn’t work as I need to know how to do python for the end of term piece. Another problem is the opposite if I get stuck for a long time and I just kind of get stuck for a long time and by the time I’m done my partners are 2 or 3 steps ahead of me. So I think that I should talk to my partner if I get stuck but before that use my hint. In conclusion I would say that talking is good if you don’t do it to much this is because if you do it to much it makes you lose you focus. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>next time I will try and be a bit more productive as I have been quite slow to doing a couple of them, because of the reasons I have previously just mentioned. This would be better as I and my partners have quite a long way to go as we have completed two of the main sections but there is 13 and we only have a term to complete them so we need to speed up a little bit more. Next time I will try and make it so we could try and complete one and a half or even two main sections. I will improve my learning by using the strategies I mentioned into the box at the top and some other strategies that I will put in my next blog. These will help me and hopefully in two weeks I will be doing two main sections a week to try and speed it up some more </td>
