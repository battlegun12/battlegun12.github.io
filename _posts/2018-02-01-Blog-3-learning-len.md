    <td>The strategies that were effective were : if I used the sheet that she gave us to be able to learn what code we needed to get the print option we wanted to work out correctly. If we got it to work correctly then we could get some cool things going like your name is Thomas aiden James Treloar. The strategies that I found effective where if it said syntax error I would ask or look at my partners code and see if I've done something I wasn’t meant to or if I need to add something or even just ask him if there’s anything that he put down which I hadn’t this would of worked, because then he could do the same for me and it helped you understand why and what the code does to your program as sometimes it might say syntax error on line 1 and you have to go to line 1 and look at it closely 1 step at a time being sure to make no mistakes then when you find it you can check against the code our teacher put on classroom and then we can be sure about what’s wrong. I learnt by using my knowledge of other coding website I had done previously however some of the stages could be hard like having to write 5 lines or as easy as just pressing run. I think that I could of done more work however as although I did get through a chunk I think I could of got through a bit more. Some good strategies were using the hint every so often as it could tell you the code or give you a hint like' remember before printing something out " before and after it’ there were many others but that was just an example. I think occasionally talking quietly to the people who sit next to you is a good idea as not only does it help you in your own code but your partner could also learn something. To give an example last lesson eddy told me I had to put the ‘ before my word and I told him it wasn’t working because he needed to have a capital letter. This works as it not only helped yourself but your peers around you. This lesson we were focusing on putting details about yourself in a graph using the one tool or at the end of worksheet one programming it to make a passcode. These link each other as you could add a passcode to the other one if you wanted and it would work out perfectly fine or you could do it vice versa where you could use your details like age and shoe size about yourself in the 2 one. This would work as it would allow either one to link with each other. I learnt by talking to my neighbour Charlie and sometimes using what he did and then editing it s bit to create a better version of it. Charlie and I could help each other out by using the code we both have together to create a complete code as I could be missing the capital and he could be missing the space so together we would have gotten a successful code by working together. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that i was reading off the page sometimes so although I might of learnt a little bit I wasn’t actually learning to my full potential as if I was learning to my full potential I could of probably although done a bit less I could of learnt a whole lot more which means that I wouldn’t of have had to do as much homework as that was to spend 10 minutes a day on code academy python. In the future I think I would want to redo that lesson to as best as I can as I think I can do a lot better than what I had actually done as I am normally quite hard working but that lesson I took quite lightly. The final thing that limited my learning was the fact that I may of been talking to my partner a little bit too much and not doing it by myself all the time. I could of used my knowledge a bit more and been more proficient </td>

    <td>Next time i will be more productive and we as a group will learn more from our mistakes. I will improve my learning by doing more work in the lesson talking less to other groups getting distracted less and helping myself and my partner. This will allow me to be more productive in the meantime also helping my partner. This week we learnt how to use real python not just codecademy python as for homework we had to do 10 minutes a day and in the lesson we did some cool things with the print tool as it allowed us to type our full name word by word with initials and everything like that. This also allowed me to see what it was doing. In the future lessons of the term I will improve my working by listening more and chatting less in the times when I do and don’t need to. </td>
